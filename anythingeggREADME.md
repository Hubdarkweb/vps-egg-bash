Creating a custom **Pterodactyl egg** for hosting any type of service, including **web applications, bots, and more**, on different operating systems (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS) requires creating a flexible environment. I'll outline a basic **egg** template and configuration that could be used to deploy a wide variety of applications in Pterodactyl, no matter the server's OS (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS).

### Key Features of This Egg:
1. **Cross-OS Compatibility**: It should work on Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS.
2. **Generic Setup**: It will run a custom startup script that can be configured to launch any type of service (e.g., web apps, bots, or other services).
3. **Customizable User Input**: Users will be able to provide input for any necessary environment variables, such as custom configuration files, application-specific settings, etc.
4. **Docker Image**: Use a flexible base Docker image that can work on all these OS environments (such as a Debian-based container that can run on Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS).

### Pterodactyl Egg for General Purpose Hosting

Here's an example of the **egg configuration**:

```json

  ]
}
```

### Explanation of the Key Sections:

1. **Docker Image**:
   - The image `ghcr.io/parkervcp/yolks:debian` is being used as the base image because it's flexible enough to work on various systems like Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS. You can adjust this to other base images (e.g., `ubuntu` or `centos`) if you prefer.

2. **Installation Script**:
   - The installation script installs basic utilities (`curl`, `jq`, and `git`) and prepares the system for various services.
   - You can customize this installation script for specific applications, such as installing Node.js for a bot or Python for other services.
   - The script makes the `/mnt/server` directory the working directory and executes any additional commands you define (like installing dependencies or cloning repositories).

3. **Variables**:
   - **SERVICE TYPE**: A customizable variable allowing users to specify what kind of service they're hosting (e.g., `web`, `bot`, `game server`, etc.).
   - **STARTUP SCRIPT**: A variable where users can specify a custom startup script (e.g., `start.sh`) that defines how to start their service.
   - **APP CONFIGURATION**: This variable allows the user to specify a path to any custom configuration files needed for their application.

4. **Startup Command**:
   - The startup command runs the `start.sh` script, which can be customized based on the service type the user is running. The startup script should be responsible for starting the application (e.g., starting a web server, a bot, or any other service).

### How This Egg Works:
1. **Create a Server**: In the Pterodactyl panel, create a new server using this custom egg.
2. **Configure Variables**:
   - Set the `SERVICE TYPE` to the application type you want to run (e.g., `web` for a web app or `bot` for a bot).
   - Set the `STARTUP SCRIPT` variable to point to the appropriate startup script for the service you're hosting (e.g., `start.sh`).
   - Optionally, set the `APP CONFIGURATION` variable if your service requires a configuration file (e.g., `config.json` for a web app).
3. **Upload Files**: Upload the required files, such as your applicationâ€™s JAR file (for Java apps), `.py` file (for Python bots), or `index.js` (for Node.js web apps).
4. **Start the Server**: Press the "Start" button in Pterodactyl. The container will execute the `start.sh` script, starting your service.

### Customization for Specific Use Cases:
- **Web Application**: For a Node.js web app, you could modify the `installation` script to install Node.js, and the `start.sh` script could use `node index.js` to launch the app.
- **Bot**: If you're hosting a bot (e.g., a Discord bot), you could install Python or Node.js, depending on the language of the bot. The `start.sh` script would run something like `python bot.py` or `node bot.js`.
- **Game Server or Other Services**: Adjust the installation and startup scripts to install the necessary dependencies for game servers or other applications.

### Summary:
This **Pterodactyl egg** provides a flexible and customizable way to host a variety of services (web applications, bots, game servers, etc.) on different Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS). By allowing the user to specify the service type, configuration files, and startup scripts, this egg can be easily adapted to fit many hosting scenarios.
